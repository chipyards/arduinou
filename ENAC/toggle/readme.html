Toggle button : press shortly to start, press again to stop.

A simple push button can be operated as a toggle button by software.
This requires 2 static boolean variables :
	- button previous state
	- toggle state

Note: on this diagram, the button pressed state is represented as "high".
In the program example, the button, being connected to ground and pulled up
by a resistor, works inverted. This is compensated by the software.
