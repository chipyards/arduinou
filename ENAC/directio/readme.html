This is a variant of the classical "blink-the-LED" demo.

In this experiment, functions pinMode() and digitalWrite() are not used.
I/O ports registers are accessed directly at addresses 0x24 and 0x25 by means of pointers.

Timing is done without the delay() function.
A more accurate solution is proposed, based on waiting for precalculated dates.
