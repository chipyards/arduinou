Goal : take control over the arduino in order to:
acquire and process analog information with an accurate sample rate

1) using the potentiometer as a signal source,
send the data to the serial plotter,
	- 1st channel constant value = 0
	- 2nd channel constant value = full scale = 1023
	- 3rd channel : raw ADC value
using delay() to determine the sampling period

2) use the push button to start and stop the plotting process
connect the button to a digital input configured as INPUT_PULLUP
(toggle action : press shortly to start, again to stop)

3) store the period value in a variable, allow the user to change its value
by typing a message like "T 35", where 'T' is a code identifying the variable.

4) setup a measurement of the actual loop period, assuming that millis() is accurate
	- use 2 static long variables, one for keeping the start time,
	  the other to count the loops
	- start the measurement when plotting is started,
	  stop the measurement when plotting is stopped, then send
	  the results to the plotter in one line of text (with no space)

5) replace the call to delay() by an accurate solution: a loop waiting
for millis to reach a precalculated date,
compare the accuracy

Note : using the accurate loop solution together with the maximum bit rate of
115200 bauds for the serial link to the PC allows to reduce the loop period
down to 1ms.
Note: Using the serial monitor in parallel with the seriel plotter is not possible.
But sending one word of text (not a number, and containg no space nor comma)
to the plotter replaces the first label, without other effect.
