PARSING THE NMEA SENTENCES

NMEA sentences do not follow any generic text data format like XML, JSON OR CSV.
They use a propietary format which is neither human fiendly nor machine-friendly

Possible approaches :

1) multiples passes, could be:
	- copy each sentence in a separate buffer
	- split each sentence into fields and store these in arrays of buffers (or 2D arrays)
	- identify each sentence by the first field
	- extract values from the other fields

2) pattern search
	- using a standard pattern search library like "regular expressions", extract only
	  the field of interest
	- extract the value from this field
   this is efficient only if a small fraction of the data is to be extracted

3) single pass real time parsing based on the FSM (Finite State Machine)
	- each character is processed entirely as soon as it is available 
	- a single loop contains the reception of each character and its full processing.
	- variables are used to store the "state" of the machine, which tells "what to do next"

4) single pass real time FSM hybrid approach
	- some actions may be delayed, for example character of a numerical field may be stored
	  in a temporary buffer, to be parsed by a standard number parsing function
	  like atoi() or strtod()

FINITE STATE MACHINE
	- in an ordinary program or algorithm, the current sate of the work is stored in
		- the current position in the execution flow (implicitly stored by the CPU)
		- explicit variables
	- in the FSM, the state is stored only in variables, in an explicit manner, stating
		- what is currently being done
		- what the job status is
		- where you are in the data structure
